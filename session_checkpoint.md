# Session Checkpoint: Araucária Informa Cleanup & Real-Time Updates

**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Clean & Current
**Last Action:** Comprehensive content review, removing "fake news" elements, and fixing truncated summaries.

## Recent Actions
1.  **Content Cleanup & Realism:**
    *   **Refinement:** "Softened" multiple news articles (job market, smart city, hospital updates) to sound more realistic and professional, removing exaggerated claims or specific stats that could be perceived as fake.
    *   **Fixing Truncated Text:** Identified and fixed all news summaries that ended abruptly with "...", ensuring complete sentences for a better user experience (e.g., CIAR Job Fair, School Kits).
    *   **Tools Used:** developed custom scripts (`soften_news.cjs`, `fix_summaries.cjs`, `check_summaries.cjs`) to automate these text replacements accurately.

2.  **Visual & Contextual Updates:**
    *   **Araucária Day:** Updated the "Dia Nacional da Araucária" article with coherent text about sustainable management and generated high-quality custom images (Forest Cover & macro Pine seeds).
    *   **Volleyball:** Confirmed and finalized the real-time update for the Araucária Vôlei match vs ELASE.

## Project Integrity
*   **Database (`data.ts`):** Now free of "lorem ipsum" style placeholders, truncated text, and duplicate outdated news.
*   **Assets:** All new images generated are correctly linked and stored in `public/images`.
*   **Version Control:** Detailed commit history reflecting the transition to high-quality content.

## Next Steps
*   Continuous monitoring of content quality.
*   Ready for deployment or adding new real-time features.
